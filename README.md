# EDA--Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This notebook has 50 different graphs
I started this kernel just for fun. I wanted to take the 50 Plot Challenge using mainly Matplotlib, but somehow it has grown into much more.

I hope that anyone, regardless of their python skills can find something useful and helpful.
